# Cliffwalking
An implementation of the cliffwalking scenario in GridWorld.


`cliff_dqn.py` trains an agent to reach the goal state using a Deep-Q-Network. `cliff_q.py` trains an agent to reach the goal state using traditional q-learning.

A directory called `results` must be created beforehand in the same directory as `cliff_dqn.py` and `cliff_q.py` if results are to be saved. These are saved as `.csv` files.

Completed as part of the Individual Project (CS3010) module at Aston University.
